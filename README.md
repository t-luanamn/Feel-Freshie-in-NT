# Solution :: Tourism Gamification in NT
Tourism Adventure Game App for Northern Territory

## Story for the Prototype
A Tourist's Journey: Meet "Sam," a first-time visitor to the Northern Territory. Sam opens the app to begin exploring, instantly drawn to the Adventure category. Sam chooses to visit Nitmiluk National Park, where they meet an AR ranger NPC guiding them to hidden waterfalls and offering trivia on the park's Indigenous history. After arrived the destination, Sam earns EXP and unlocks a 10% discount on gear rentals.
Next, Sam switches gears and explores the cultural side of NT by visiting the Darwin Festival. Here, they meet an AR performer and complete a challenge to find hidden festival clues using the app. Completing the challenge unlocks a Level Up in the Festival category, earning Sam a free meal voucher at a nearby restaurant.
As Sam continues to explore, they build up their profile, unlocking badges, perks, and discounts, making every step of the journey rewarding. Sam’s overall status rises in different categories, with the goal of unlocking passive abilities that help on future trips—like cheaper road trips or priority access to popular events.

## Nomad's Next Territory

> "Embark on a journey to unlock and explore new destinations across diverse landscapes and cultures in your NT adventure."

## Introduction
This mobile app aims to boost tourism in the Northern Territory by gamifying travel experiences. Tourists will be able to choose from four different travel styles and collect experience points (EXP) as they explore various locations, which can be redeemed for in-app perks like discounts at restaurants and accommodations.
## Game Concept
The game will offer four different travel types for tourists to select based on their age, preferences, and interests:
* Adventure
* Road Trip
* Culture and Local Experiences
* Festivals

## Key Features
### Leveling and Rewards System
The tourist earns Experience Points (EXP) by visiting specific destinations across four travel types: Adventure, Road Trip, Culture, and Festival.

> #### Location Verification:
> The app will use GPS tracking to verify that tourists are physically present at the location before allowing them to claim EXP.

> #### EXP Collection:
> Tourists earn EXP by entering the destination site.

> #### Level Up:
> As tourists gain EXP in each category, they level up and unlock benefits like:
> * Adventure category: Discount on gear rentals.
> * Culture category: Free entry to cultural events or discounted workshops.
> * Festival category: VIP access to events.
> * Road Trip category: Gas station discounts or car rental upgrades.

### Party System
Group Travel Features: Tourists can add friends to a party for shared adventures.
Friend Locator: The app displays the live location of party members, making group travel more fun and safe by reducing the risk of someone getting lost.

### Crocodile Safety Alert System
Real-time Safety Notifications: Given the prevalence of crocodiles in the NT, the app will feature alerts for high-risk zones where crocodile activity is reported.
Tourist and Ranger Safety: The system helps both tourists and officials monitor safe areas and crowded spots. It uses crowd-sourced data, allowing tourists to report sightings that differ from the system’s data for improved accuracy.

### Route for Today
Personalised Routes: Based on the number of days and interests provided by the tourist, the app generates tailored travel routes.
Map Feature: Routes are color-coded to show destinations categorised under the four travel types, helping tourists stay on track.

### Daily Quest System
Special Alerts: The app provides daily quests in nearby areas of interest, such as participating in local festivals.
Bonus EXP: Completing these quests offers double EXP rewards to encourage active exploration.

### Status and Skill System
Every tourist has a profile showing their overall progress across categories, including badges and achievements they’ve unlocked.
> #### Skill Tree:
> The profile includes a skill tree representing active and passive abilities. For instance:
> * Active Skills: Earn discounts on food or travel gear when performing specific actions (like  visiting two cultural landmarks in a day).
> * Passive Skills: Gain long-term perks like reduced travel costs or priority booking for popular experiences.

> #### Unlockable Perks:
> Mechanics: Some perks are locked until certain status criteria are met. For example:
> * 5% Restaurant Discount: Unlocked by reaching Level 5 in the Festival category.
> * Free Entry to National Parks: Earned by reaching Level 10 in Adventure.

### Conclusion
The app not only enhances the NT tourism experience by encouraging exploration but also rewards tourists, helping them feel accomplished as they level up their travel profiles. The added safety and party features create an engaging, safe, and social experience for visitors.
