# Story for the Prototype
A Tourist's Journey: Meet "Sam," a first-time visitor to the Northern Territory. Sam opens the app to begin exploring, instantly drawn to the Adventure category. Sam chooses to visit Nitmiluk National Park, where they meet an AR ranger NPC guiding them to hidden waterfalls and offering trivia on the park's Indigenous history. After arrived the destination, Sam earns EXP and unlocks a 10% discount on gear rentals.
Next, Sam switches gears and explores the cultural side of NT by visiting the Darwin Festival. Here, they meet an AR performer and complete a challenge to find hidden festival clues using the app. Completing the challenge unlocks a Level Up in the Festival category, earning Sam a free meal voucher at a nearby restaurant.
As Sam continues to explore, they build up their profile, unlocking badges, perks, and discounts, making every step of the journey rewarding. Sam’s overall status rises in different categories, with the goal of unlocking passive abilities that help on future trips—like cheaper road trips or priority access to popular events.

# Prototype Design Concept
## Leveling and Rewards System
### Level Progression:
#### Mechanics:
The tourist earns Experience Points (EXP) by visiting specific destinations across four travel types: Adventure, Road Trip, Culture, and Festival.
#### Location Verification:
The app will use GPS tracking to verify that tourists are physically present at the location before allowing them to claim EXP.
#### EXP Collection:
Tourists earn EXP by entering the destination site.
#### Level Up:
As tourists gain EXP in each category, they level up and unlock benefits like:
* Adventure category: Discount on gear rentals.
* Culture category: Free entry to cultural events or discounted workshops.
* Festival category: VIP access to events.
* Road Trip category: Gas station discounts or car rental upgrades.

## Status and Skill System
### Tourist Profile:
#### Overview:
Every tourist has a profile showing their overall progress across categories, including badges and achievements they’ve unlocked.
#### Skill Tree:
The profile includes a skill tree representing active and passive abilities. For instance:
* Active Skills: Earn discounts on food or travel gear when performing specific actions (like visiting two cultural landmarks in a day).
* Passive Skills: Gain long-term perks like reduced travel costs or priority booking for popular experiences.
#### Unlockable Perks:
Mechanics: Some perks are locked until certain status criteria are met. For example:
* 5% Restaurant Discount: Unlocked by reaching Level 5 in the Festival category.
* Free Entry to National Parks: Earned by reaching Level 10 in Adventure.

## Map View Interface Design

### Main Map Screen
The Map View serves as the central hub for tourists to explore the Northern Territory (NT). It is an interactive, zoomable map that highlights key tourist destinations, categorised by the four travel types (Adventure, Road Trip, Culture, and Festival).
### Navigation and EXP Tracking
As tourists explore the NT, the map will dynamically update their progress and unlock new features.
### Dynamic Recommendations
The app suggests nearby destinations based on the tourist’s progress and remaining EXP to level up in certain categories.
Example: “You’re 50 EXP away from a free meal voucher—visit a cultural site nearby to earn more EXP!”

## Category EXP Bar Interface Design

### Overview of the Category EXP Bar
The Category EXP Bar visualises a tourist’s progress within the four main travel categories: Adventure, Road Trip, Culture, and Festival. Each bar tracks how many Experience Points (EXP) a user has earned in that category and how close they are to leveling up.
#### Four Category Bars: One for each of the main travel types.
* Adventure: Green EXP bar.
* Road Trip: Blue EXP bar.
* Culture: Orange EXP bar.
* Festival: Purple EXP bar.

#### EXP Progress Indicator:
Each bar is filled based on the tourist’s current EXP progress, showing the percentage completed toward the next level.
#### Level Indicator:
The current level for each category is displayed alongside the bar (e.g., "Level 3").

## Profile Screen Interface Design

The Profile Screen provides a summary of a tourist's overall progress, status, and achievements across all travel categories (Adventure, Road Trip, Culture, Festival). It acts as the central dashboard for users to check their level, unlock perks, pending challenges, and their in-app status, serving as a motivational hub.

## Skills Display Interface Design

### Overview of the Skills Tree
The Skills Display functions as a branching visual map where users can explore and unlock abilities or perks across four travel categories: Adventure, Road Trip, Culture, and Festival. Each category has its own branch of the tree with unique unlockable skills.
